##  About the Project
- Our solution methodology is based around the idea of “gamification of real-world
scenarios” in order to solve the problems posed by them in an efficient manner.
Our aim was not only to find a solution to improving the workplace productivity
but a solution that can make the workplace a more fun environment for the
employee.<br>
- We have tried to come up with a solution that increases the competitiveness
amongst the employees in the workplace and converts their workplace into a
literal virtual battlefield where each of their efforts are not only acknowledged but
also rewarded, where they can see the each other’s progress.<br>
- Incentivizing each small progress that they make and then making it public solves
two of the problems this not only makes the work that the employees do more fun
but also makes the workplace more competitive thus increasing the overall
productivity of the workplace, also as each of their progress is recorded and
analyzed it would be very easy for the HR team and the leader of the employee’s
team to evaluate the employee during their appraisals and then also provide solid
proof to the employee for the same, thus helping the employee to identify their
weak points and work towards it till their next appraisal.<br>
